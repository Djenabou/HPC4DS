# HPC4DS - High Performance Computing For Data Science
## Provided jointly by Warwick RSE and The Alan Turing Institute

These materials accompany our remote-learning workshop on skills for
using High Performance Computing facilities in Data Science research. This Workshop
is presented as a series of video lectures, with exercises and code examples for
self-study.

# Where to Find the Videos and Examples

The videos, examples etc are available via the University of Warwick web pages [here](https://warwick.ac.uk/hpc4ds)
Videos are provided via Youtube.

# How to Use these Materials

These snippets are intended to support the material for study. Look for the mentions in <span style="color:#00407A"><b>Warwick-Blue </b>/span> within the pdf instructions. 

To run these, you will need either Jupyter, or Python depending. We use Python 3.5. The scripts assume you are on a system which provides /usr/bin/env and refers to Python-3 as python3.

## What if I'm on Windows?

We mostly assume that you are using a Linux-based system, such as Ubuntu, Mac-OS, or Debian. If you
are using Windows, we would recommend a Virtual Machine running one of these. Ubuntu is user-friendly
and VMs are easy to obtain. 

In Windows 10 it is possible to do many of the examples using the Windows Subsystem for Linux, but we
have not tested this
