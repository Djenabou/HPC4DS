# HPC4DS - High Performance Computing For Data Science
## Provided jointly by Warwick RSE and The Alan Turing Institute

These materials accompany our remote-learning workshop on skills for
using High Performance Computing facilities in Data Science research. This Workshop
is presented as a series of video lectures, with exercises and code examples for
self-study.

# Where to Find the Videos and Examples

The videos, examples etc are available via the University of Warwick web pages [here](https://warwick.ac.uk/hpc4ds)
Videos are provided via Youtube.

# How to Use these Materials

These snippets are intended to support the material for study. Look for the mentions in Warwick-Blue within the pdf instructions. 

To run these, you will need either Jupyter, or Python depending. We use Python 3.5. The scripts assume you are on a system which provides /usr/bin/env and refers to Python-3 as python3.
